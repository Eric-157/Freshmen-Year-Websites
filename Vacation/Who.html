<h1> Who is the Customer </h1>
<br>
<h2> The customer for a trip like this is someone who is adventurous, who loves hikes and sights. Someone who is fine with losing some sleep if they go in the summer or can endure the cold if they go in the winter. If you're the customer for this trip then make sure you remember to bring blankets and jackets in the winter and bring a face mask in the summer to help sleep while the sun is up. </h2>
