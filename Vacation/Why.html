<h1> Why did I choose the Swedish Laplands </h1>
<br>
<h2> I chose the Swedish Laplands because I love Sweden. Eventually once I'm old enough I plan on going to Sweden and explore before life tells me I can't explore the world anymore. The main place I've wanted to go is the Arctic Circle in Sweden as not only can I expierence the Midnight Sun, but I also can go on hikes, visit the ice hotel, and when I'm done in the Laplands, I can move down to southern Sweden to explore stockholm. </h2>
